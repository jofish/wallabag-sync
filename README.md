# wallabag-sync
Save your wallabag pages locally as html.  Includes an option to import Pocket exports.

The interesting thing, of course, is leaving this running on a server with a cron job, and having it write your file to Dropbox (or the cloud service provider of your choice), which then syncs to your laptop, meaning **everything you save in Wallabag gets indexed by Spotlight** (or, again, the on-laptop search system of your choice).
